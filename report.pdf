## 1Ô∏è‚É£ FIR Filter Design Using Window Method

### A. Impulse Response Formulation

* **Low-pass filter impulse response:**

  ```math
  h_{LP}(n) = \frac{\sin(w_c n)}{\pi n}
  ```
* **Band-stop filter impulse response:**

  ```math
  h_{BP}(n) = \delta(n) - h_{LP,w2}(n) + h_{LP,w1}(n)
  ```

### B. Window Selection

* **Chosen window:** Hamming
* **Specifications:**

  * Mainlobe width (-3 dB): `0.042969`
  * Relative sidelobe attenuation: `-42.4 dB`
  * Filter order: `N = 61`

### C. Frequency Response

* Generated and compared both ideal and practical band-stop filter frequency responses.

### D. Sine Signal Testing

* Tested sine waves at œÄ/5, 9œÄ/20, and œÄ/10.
* Results:

  * Passband signals passed through filter.
  * Stopband signals attenuated as expected.
  * Group delay matched theoretical predictions.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ IIR Filter Design Using Bilinear Transform

### A. Analog Butterworth Low-Pass Filter

* **Design parameters:**

  * Œ©‚ÇÅ = `0.5359 rad/s`
  * Œ©‚ÇÇ = `0.8284 rad/s`
  * Filter order `N = 3` (computed from `N ‚âà 2.52`)
  * Cutoff Œ©c = `0.574 rad/s`
* **Transfer function:**

  ```math
  |H(jŒ©)|^2 = \frac{1}{1 + (Œ© / Œ©_c)^{2N}}
  ```

### B. Digital Conversion

* Applied bilinear transformation:

  ```math
  s = \frac{2}{T} \frac{1 - z^{-1}}{1 + z^{-1}}
  ```

### C. Validation

* Compared Bode plots of practical and theoretical analog filters.
* Compared frequency responses of practical and theoretical digital filters.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ High-Pass Filter Attempt (Impulse Invariance Method)

* Impulse invariance method failed at high frequencies (violated Shannon's condition).
* Bilinear transform produced near-spec results:

  * |H(w1)| = `-2.24 dB` (target: ‚â§ -3 dB)
  * |H(w2)| = `-10.63 dB` (target: ‚â§ -10 dB\`)

---

## üìå Conclusion

* FIR filter design met performance specs using the Hamming window.
* IIR low-pass Butterworth design succeeded in both theoretical and practical tests.
* High-pass filter design was not feasible via impulse invariance; bilinear transform results were close but not exact.

## üí° Notes

* Simulations conducted using MATLAB with Signal Processing Toolbox (`freqz`, `grpdelay`, `buttord`, `bilinear`).
